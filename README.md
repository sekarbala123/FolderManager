# **FolderManager**  

## **Overview**  
**FolderManager** is a simple Java Swing-based GUI application that helps users manage folders efficiently. It allows users to add folders to a table, open them in **File Explorer**, delete them, and save/load the folder list for future use.  

## **Use Case**  
### **Problem Statement**  
Users often work with multiple folders and need an easy way to manage them. Manually opening, deleting, and tracking folders can be time-consuming.  

### **Solution**  
FolderManager provides an intuitive GUI that allows users to:  
- **Add Folders** â€“ Select and add folders to a table.  
- **Open Folders** â€“ Open a folder in **File Explorer** with a click.  
- **Delete Folders** â€“ Remove folders from the list and delete them from the system.  
- **Save/Load Folder List** â€“ Store and retrieve folders from a file for easy reuse.  

### **Example Scenario**  
1. The user launches **FolderManager**.  
2. Clicks **"Add Folder"** to select a folder and add it to the table.  
3. Clicks **"Open"** to open a folder in **File Explorer**.  
4. Clicks **"Delete"** to remove a folder (after confirmation).  
5. Clicks **"Save List"** to store the folder paths.  
6. Clicks **"Load List"** to restore the saved folder paths.
